So in this I will solve all the Master Challs

## Name - Are you the Master? 0

So we are given with a broken image ,lets fix it

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/26.png)

here you can see that ``` png, ihdr, idat ``` chucks are improper they need to be all capital even `Iend` chunk was also corrupt so we fix all of them

finally should look somethiing like this

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/27.png)
 
it should now be able to open and look like this!

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/final.png)

while fixing we see that there is a link included in the end of the image 
<tinyurl.com/y7kfm58j>

visiting the link gets us the flag.bps file , I searched for it online and found that this file was used to patch the game roms with some super awesome hacks!!

Next I looked if there are any past ctf questions related to this bfs file and yes there was a very recent question from **WPICTF** this the link to [writeup](https://aadibajpai.com/blog/p/ttL4fYDn.html) that I found most useful 

I downloaded the Floating IPS software for windows and tries patching the image with the bfs file given it gave error ,
I asked author wether the image was corrupted or anything
then skip to 12 pm on 6-may there was a hint released that we need to remove the trailing bytes before patching so i wrote a quick and ugly python script to remove the bytes 

NOTE- `42 60 80` are the ending bytes of png

```python
f=open("final.png","rb")
data=f.read()
f.close()

print hex(ord(data[0x235b]))
# for i in data:
	# print ord(i)

data=data[:0x235b]

print hex(ord(data[-1]))

fl=open("final_patch.png","wb")
arr=bytearray(data)
fl.write(arr)
fl.close()
```
after that we try to patch and its a success so we got the flag

Moving on to next chall

## Name - Are you the Master? 1

here we are given with a website, nothing special

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/28.png)

Seeing the word collision hinted me that there must be some type of hash collison related to php

SO I check the source code

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/29.png)

hint to visit view.php
lets see what we have there

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/30.png)

SO we have a source code for the page;
SO we have 2 parameters ; **one** and **two**

we have to supply such arguments that the condition ```md5(one)==md5(two)``` returns true so we get the ans

So I had a repo bookmarked which had  some very useful things related to php hash collision
this is the [link](https://github.com/spaze/hashes)

visit the md5 section and take the first two strings as the one and two

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/31.png)

strange the gif is not available ,lets check the source


![](images/zh3r0_ctf/32.png)


these look like ascii chars so we move to cyberchef and it automatically suggests the conversion

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/33.png)

we get the url and submit that as a flag!!

## Name - Are you the Master? 2

So for this we are given a python file and RSA.txt
SO the file logic was simple We are given N1,N2 , e, Ct1,ct2
and there was also a file we get from the drive link that we have from previous challenge 

C=p+q+r+s
D=(p-q)-(r-s)

SO this was a maths problem not a rsa one 

I will share my some very clumsy notes as to how I figured it out

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/34.png)

this is my script 

```python

print(long_to_bytes(m))

```

this gives us the flag

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/35.png)

## Name - Are you the Master? 2

So here the drive provide us with a iv binary and img.txt

So opening up the binary in ghidra showed nothing ,it was just to print the strings ,"Its a string"
Upon reading the message i got that i have to run the strings on binary 

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/36.png)

NOTE- remove the char `H` it seems to redundant
we get our iv

I asked author about the ,key, very dumb of me 
It was the flag from last master chall

now I write a script for AES-CBC decrypt as the cyberchef was not supporting me that day

cipher text is the img.txt

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import binascii
import base64

key="zh3r0{Th1s_1s_4_K3y_gfh}"
print(len(key))
AES.key_size=192
b64="ryq9rkoU+XhtIuoFAvujDQ=="
IV=base64.b64decode(b64)

decipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC,IV)

msg="<REDACTED>"

ct=base64.b64decode(msg)

print(decipher.decrypt(ct))

```

We get a base64 data we deccrypt it and save to file !

we open hexedit and find this!

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/37.png)

So once again we need to correct headers ,the chucks png ihdr,idat,and iend need to be fixed
fixed image has hex something like this

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/38.png)

Save this and view the file its now possible to see the flag!

![](images/zh3r0_ctf/newimg)

So I thats it for today!!!

Hope you liked it!!!
